#Question 1:
 # Are any physiological indicators associated with schizophrenia? Early studies, based largely on postmortem
#analysis, suggest that the sizes of certain areas of the brain may be different in persons afflicted with
#schizophrenia than others. Confounding variables in these studies, however, clouded the issue considerably.
#In a 1990 article, researchers reported the results of a study that controlled for genetic and socioeconomic
#differences by examining 15 pairs of monozygotic twins, where one of the twins was schizophrenic and the
#other was not. The twins were located through an intensive search throughout Canada and the United States.
#The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging to measure the volumes (in cm$^3$) of several regions and
#subregions inside the twins' brains. The figure below presents a dotplot based on the reported summary
#statistics from one subregion, the left hippocampus. What is the magnitude of the difference in volumes of the
#left hippocampus between unaffected and the affected individuals? Can the observed difference be attributed
#to chance?

###Question2
#Marine biologists warn that the growing number of powerboats registered in Florida threatens the existence
#of manatees. The data file Manatees2015.csv comes from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation
#Commission (myfwcm.com/research/manatee/) and the U.S. Coast Guard Office of Auxiliary and Boating
#Safety (www.uscgboating.org/library/accident-statistics/Recreational-Boating-Statistics-2015.pdf).
#You are to investigate the association between number of powerboats registered (in thousands) and
#number of manatees deaths.

Manatees<-read.csv("Manatees_2015.csv")
Manatees
#a). In this context, which one is the response variable?

#explanatory variable is powerboat registrations
#response variables is manatees killed
```


```{r}
#b). Make a scatterplot of these data and describe the association you see. Paste your graph here.

ggplot(Manatees, aes(x=Powerboat.Registrations.000s., y= Manatees.Killed)) + geom_point()
```


```{r}
#c) Find the correlation between Boat Registration and Manatee Deaths. Comment on the number. Does it
#agree with the scatterplot in part b.

correlation<-cor(Manatees$Manatees.Killed,Manatees$Powerboat.Registrations.000s.)
correlation
# correlation is .9508
```


```{r}
#d) If appropriate create a linear model of the association between Manatee Deaths and Powerboat
#Registrations.

lm(Manatees.Killed~Powerboat.Registrations.000s., data=Manatees)
#Estimated Model:
#manatees.Killed= -52.4149+ .1439(Powerboat.Registrations.000s.)
```


```{r}
#e) Interpret the slope of your model and y intercept
#Note: (unit of the slope: #deaths per 1000 boat registration)

#.1439/1. change in y over change in x. 
#for every 1(1000 boat registrations) you add .1439 to manatee deaths per year

#the y intercept is when x=0.. this is where the point crosses
#the y axis. that is the initial number and with every
#1000 deaths( or we say 1) then we add .1439 to the -52.4149

#we can obviously not have negative amount of manatees killed (this is when x=0),
#but this is an equation that gives a reference and for the most part manatees killed is positive
#therefore the x has to atleast surpass around 400 in order to have a functioning equation of
#manatees killed. for example
# -52.4149+ .1439*(365)=.10 ~0 manatee deaths
#so around x=365(thousand) to get the manatees deaths to be in the positives and have the equation
#actually be useful
```

#f). Interpret the value of 𝑹𝟐

#The plot below is a scatterplot of the corn yield versus rainfall in six U.S. corn-producing states (Iowa,

#i)
#Do you think a simple linear regression model is adequate here?

#The linear regression model is not adequite. there doesnt seem to be a linear line and if anything
#it looks curved at around 11 inches of rain.


#How do you describe the relationship between rainfall and corn yields.

#It seems that if there is around 12 inches of rainfall, there seems to be more corn yield. 
#as stated in i. the chart increases then decreases. it looks that if there is
#more than 12 inches of rain the trend of the corn yield seems to decrease.
```


```{r}
#ii)
#TRUE/FALSE
#Increasing rainfall is associated with higher mean corn yields.

#FALSE, UP UNTIL AROUND 12 INCHES


#Increasing rainfall is associated with higher mean corn yields for rainfalls up
#to 12 inches, increasing rainfall at higher levels is associated with no change
#or perhaps a decrease in mean yield.

#TRUE 

#Looks like the rainfall effect does not depend on the rainfall level.

#FALSE

residuals
ggplot(data = ex0915, mapping = aes(x = Year, y = residuals)) +
  geom_point()



##TRUE There is a trend; residuals tend to increase with increasing years.

#TRUE This means that the actual yield is larger than what is predicted from the regression of yield on rainfall
#for years

#closer to 1927 and smaller than predicted for years closer to 1890.
#TRUE For a given amount of rainfall, the yield per acre tended to be larger in the later years than in the
#earlier years.
#This might be due to improvements in technology.
```


```{r}
#iv) The model incorporates curvature by having the effect of rainfall be different at different levels of
#rainfall: (Simplify the expression below). Recall

#   mu{corn|rain+1) - mu{corn|rain} = B2(2rain + 1 - rain^2)
```

#Estimate the effect of a unit increase in
#rainfall from 8 to 9 inches.

#Estimate the effect of a unit increase in
#rainfall from 14 to 15 inches.

-0.23 * (2 * 15 + 1 - 14^2)
#37.95
#NOTE: No need to interpret the individual coefficients in this example (difficult and unnecessary). The
#statistical significance of the squared rainfall coefficient is that it highlights the inadequacy of the straight-line
#regression model and suggests that increasing yield is associated with increasing rainfall only up to a point.
